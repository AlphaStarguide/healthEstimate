# Changelog
## 2.5.0.1
- Added a generic system support. The module should now work with any system whose actors have HP set up as either `token.actor.data.data.attributes.hp` or `token.actor.data.data.hp`.
- Fixed an issue where the module would fail to work because of a refactoring issue.

## 2.5.0.0
- New release under a new repo.
